# 1. List credentials

When a user opens the "My Collectors" tab in your app, they should see:
- A list of all their configured credentials.
- The current status of each collector (active, error, needs authentication, etc...).
- Basic information about each collector (supplier name, account identifier).
- Options to manage their credentials (view, re-connect and delete).

Flow:
1. The first thing to do is to create the user in our database using the [`POST /user`](/docs/api.mdx#tag/User/paths/~1user/post) endpoint.
2. Then you can use the user `id` to get its credentials with the endpoint [`GET /user/{user_id}/credentials`](/docs/api.mdx#tag/Credential-(bearer)/paths/~1user~1{user_id}~1credentials/get).
3. Render the credentials on your frontend in a nice table.

    participant User
    participant Frontend as Your Frontend
    participant Backend as Your Backend
    participant API as Invoice-Collector API

    User->>Frontend: Opens "My Collectors" tab
    Frontend->>Backend: Request user credentials
    Backend->>API: POST /user
    API-->>Backend: Returns user
    Backend->>API: GET /user/{user_id}/credentials
    API-->>Backend: Returns user credentials
    Backend-->>Frontend: Render credentials in table
    Frontend-->>User: Display collectors list
```

Here is an example of what the table displayed on your frontend could look like:

<br/>
<div style={{ textAlign: 'right' }}>
    <Button label="Add collector" link="add-credential" />
</div>
<br/>
<div className="table-container">

### Display actions depending on the collector state

When getting the credentials with the endpoint [`GET /user/{user_id}/credentials`](/docs/api.mdx#tag/Credential-(bearer)/paths/~1user~1{user_id}~1credentials/get),
you will see that each credential has a field called `state`. Actions displayed in the table depends on the `state.index` value.
See [Credential state](../credential-state) for more infos.
