## 1. Iframe integration (Quick & Easy)

The iFrame integration is the fastest way to add Invoice-Collector to your application.
With this approach, the credential addition process is embedded in our pre-built interface.
All the complex API interactions are handled automatically within the iframe, especialy the WebSocket connection and events handling.

The only thing to do is display an iframe with url:
```javascript
/ui?token=${token}
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Fastest integration** - Get up and running in minutes
- 🔒 **Secure by default** - Credentials never pass through your frontend
- 🎨 **Pre-built UI** - No need to design credential collection forms
- 🔄 **Automatic updates** - Always get the latest features and collectors
- 📱 **Responsive design** - Works seamlessly on all devices

**How it works:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend as Your Frontend
    participant IFrame as Invoice-Collector iFrame
    participant API as Invoice-Collector API
    
    User->>Frontend: Clicks "Add Collector"
    Frontend->>IFrame: GET /ui?token={token}
    IFrame->>API: GET /collectors
    API-->>IFrame: Returns collectors
    IFrame-->>User: Displays supplier selection
    User->>IFrame: Selects supplier & enters credentials
    IFrame->>API: POST /credential
    API-->>IFrame: Returns credential
    IFrame->>API: Establishes WebSocket connection /ws
    API-->>IFrame: Sends real-time updates
    IFrame-->>User: Shows progress
    User->>IFrame: Provides updates
    IFrame->>API: Sends updates via WebSocket
    API-->>IFrame: Sends progress updates
    IFrame-->>User: Shows progress
    IFrame-->>Frontend: Sends completion event
    Frontend-->>User: Closes iFrame
```

**Perfect for:**
- MVPs and rapid prototyping
- Teams with limited frontend resources
- Applications that want to minimize maintenance
- Projects prioritizing time-to-market

### Events from Iframe to parent

In order to integrate the iframe seamlessly in your frontend, our iframe send events to your frontend to notify what panel is currently displayed in the iframe.
These events can be used to adapt the size of the iframe during the credential addition process.

Here is how events are sent from iframe:

```javascript
window.parent.postMessage(NAVIGATION_EVENT_CLOSE, '*');
```

Here are the possible events:

| Name | Format | Description | Recommended Embedding |
|---|---|---|---|
| Close | `{ type: 'ic-close' }` | The credential addition process in finished. The iframe can be closed. | ![iframe_close](../../diagrams/iframe/close.svg) |
| Panel Search | `{ type: 'ic-panel-search' }` | Current panel is "Search". User can search for a collector in the list. | ![iframe_full](../../diagrams/iframe/full.svg) |
| Panel Form | `{ type: 'ic-panel-form' }` | Current panel is "Form". User inputs are asked in a form.  | ![iframe_full](../../diagrams/iframe/full.svg) |
| Panel Feedback | `{ type: 'ic-panel-feedback' }` | Current panel is "Feedback". A small feedback form is displayed. | ![iframe_small](../../diagrams/iframe/small.svg) |
| Panel Progress | `{ type: 'ic-panel-progress' }` | Current panel is "Progress". Credential collect is in progress. | ![iframe_small](../../diagrams/iframe/small.svg) |
| Panel Canvas | `{ type: 'ic-panel-canvas' }` | Current panel is "Canvas". User needs to authenticate using video stream. | ![iframe_big](../../diagrams/iframe/big.svg) |

In the parent application, here is how the events can be catch:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    //Message received from an iframe

    // If event comes from Invoice-Collector
    if (event.origin === "https://api.invoice-collector.com") {
        if (event.data.type === 'ic-close') {
            //Close the iframe
        }
        else if (event.data.type === 'ic-panel-search') {
            //Panel "Search" is displayed
            //Recommended: Resize the iframe to full screen (eg: 100%, 100%)
        }
        else if (event.data.type === 'ic-panel-form') {
            //Panel "Form" is displayed
            //Recommended: Resize the iframe to full screen (eg: 100%, 100%)
        }
        else if (event.data.type === 'ic-panel-progress') {
            //Panel "Progress" is displayed
            //Recommended: Resize the iframe to small size (eg: 500px, 500px)
        }
        else if (event.data.type === 'ic-panel-canvas') {
            //Panel "Canvas" is displayed
            //Recommended: Resize the iframe to big size (eg: 1200px, 600px)
        }
        else if (event.data.type === 'ic-panel-feedback')
            //Panel "Progress" is displayed
            //Recommended: Resize the iframe to small size (eg: 600px, 600px)
        }
    } else {
        //Event origin is not Invoice-Collector
    }
});
```

You may resize the iframe to match your desired UX, the choice is yours.

## 2. Full integration (Complete Control)

The Full API integration gives you complete control over the user experience. Build your own interface while leveraging our powerful backend infrastructure for credential management and invoice collection.

**Key Benefits:**
- 🎨 **Full UI customization** - Design matches your brand perfectly
- 🔧 **Maximum flexibility** - Control every aspect of the user flow
- 📊 **Custom analytics** - Track user interactions your way
- 🌐 **Multi-platform** - Reuse logic across web, mobile, and desktop

**How it works:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend as Your Frontend
    participant Backend as Your Backend
    participant API as Invoice-Collector API
    
    User->>Frontend: Clicks "Add Collector"
    Frontend->>Backend: Request collectors
    Backend->>API: POST /user
    API-->>Backend: Returns user
    Backend->>API: GET /collectors
    API-->>Backend: Returns collectors
    Backend-->>Frontend: Returns collectors
    Frontend-->>User: Display supplier selection
    User->>Frontend: Selects supplier & enters credentials
    Frontend->>Backend: Submit credential
    Backend->>API: POST /credential
    API-->>Backend: Returns credential
    Backend-->>Frontend: Returns credential
    Frontend->>API: Establishes WebSocket connection /ws
    API-->>Frontend: Sends real-time updates
    Frontend-->>User: Shows progress
    User->>Frontend: Provides updates
    Frontend->>API: Sends updates via WebSocket
    API-->>Frontend: Sends progress updates
    Frontend-->>User: Shows progress
    Frontend->>User: Shows custom completion message
```

**What you need to implement:**
- Backend:
    - Call `POST /user` to create a user in our database and get the user
    - Call `GET /collectors` to list all the available collectors
    - Call `POST /user/{user_id}/credential` to create a new credential
- Frontend:
    - Create a page to display all the available collectors
    - Create a page to ask for credentials
    - Create a page to display addition progress
    - Implement WebSocket connection `/ws` and events (state, screenshot, twofa, close)

**Perfect for:**
- Enterprise applications with specific branding requirements
- Teams with strong frontend capabilities
- Applications requiring deep integration with existing workflows
- Projects needing custom validation or user guidance

### WebSocket connection

When implementing the Full API integration, you'll need to establish a WebSocket connection to receive real-time updates about the credential collection process.

**Messages Received from API:**

- **State** - Progress updates and state changes
- **Screenshot** - For interactive login when needed

**Messages Sent to API:**

- **Twofa** - Two-factor authentication code
- **Click** - Mouse click simulation during interactive login
- **Keydown** - Keyboard input during interactive login
- **Text** - Text input during interactive login
- **Close** - Complete interactive login session

For detailed information about WebSocket messages, refer to the [Websocket Messages](../websocket-messages) documentation.
