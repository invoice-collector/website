# 5. Delete a credential

When a user wants to delete a credential from your app, he can click on the Delete button in the table.

### Implementation

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th>Side</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Frontend</td>
            <td>User clicks on the `Delete` button in the table.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Backend</td>
            <td>Delete credential with endpoint [`DELETE /user/{user_id}/credential/{credential_id}`](/docs/api.mdx#tag/Credential-(bearer)/paths/~1user~1{user_id}~1credential~1{credential_id}/delete).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Frontend</td>
            <td>Update credentials table.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### How it works

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant Frontend as Your Frontend
    participant Backend as Your Backend
    participant API as Invoice-Collector API

    User->>Frontend: Clicks "Delete" button
    Frontend->>Backend: Request credential deletion
    Backend->>API: DELETE /user/{user_id}/credential/{credential_id}
    API-->>Backend: Returns
    Backend-->>Frontend: Render new table
    Frontend-->>User: Display collectors list
```
