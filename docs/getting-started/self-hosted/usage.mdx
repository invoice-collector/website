# Usage

:::info[INFO]
In this section, we assume that the _Invoice-Collector Container_ is running on port `8080`. If your container is not running yet, [see the installation section](./installation.md).
:::

The Invoice-Collector API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The server base url is:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

In this documentation, the following terms are used:

- **Customer**: Refers to you, as a self-hosted customer with free licence.
- **User**: Refers to the individual users using your self-hosted instance.

:::tip
It can be usefull to have one user per company and per private individual.
:::

## Authentication

#### Bearer Token Authentication

This authentication method is reserved for customer endpoints only. It involves sending the token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/example
```

Yon can retrieve the default user bearer token from the container logs, first run:

```bash
...
Default customer created. Bearer is "<bearer_token>". Keep it safe, it will not be displayed again.
...
```

:::warning
Be aware that we do not have access to your bearer token and it must be keeped safe. **This token has an unlimited expiry duration.**
:::

#### User token

This authentication method is reserved for user endpoints only. It involves appending the token as a query parameter in the URL.
We will see below that user tokens have a short expiry duration.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/example?token=<token>
```

## First request

We will start with a simple request to the endpoint `/customer` to retrieve your informations:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customer
```

Json body response:

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "callback": "https://path.to/callback"
}
```

This is the `callback` at which invoices will be sent. Make a POST request to the [`/customer` endpoint](../../api.mdx#/paths/~1customer/post) to update your informations by your own.

## Generate a user token

When a user on your system requests to manage collectors, you need to generate a temporary token to authorize him access to Invoice-Collector server.
You can make a POST request to the `/user` endpoint to generate the token.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/user \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "locale": "fr",
        "remote_id": "A1B2C3D4"
    }'
```

- `email` is required to send the [Terms of Use](https://invoice-collector.com/terms-of-use), allong with a verification code to the new user, it is never stored in the database. The email is immediatly sent.
- `locale` is the language of the user. Only `fr` and `en` are currently available.
- `remote_id` is used to identify the user on your system. All invoices sent to your `callback` will contain the `remote_id` allong with it so you can identify the user to whom the invoice belongs.

Json body response:

```json
{
  ...
  "token": "fca8a33006220b69dfc922596e77ffe1c2fe5d9f89664fe78f305ac836927fe52a788208d2f881fb829141eac12d2c384468d5e6a89c92dbe40f64a1366d2f22"
}
```

This user `token` has an expiry duration of 10 minutes and can be used to add and remove collectors.

## Add and remove collectors

Once you have the user token, you must redirect the user to the following endpoint to be rendered **in a browser or an iframe**: [`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ui?token=<token>`](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ui?token=REPLACE_ME)
From there, the user can add new collectors and remove existing ones.
Only the new invoices will be sent to the `callback` endpoint allong with the `remote_id`.

And that is it ðŸŽ‰ New invoices will be sent to your callback!

If like us, you have no time to waste, you can [test the callback in the next section](#test-callback).

</div>

## Test Callback

If you do not want to wait, you can directly ask the server to send a fake invoice to your callback.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/test_callback \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>"
```

Checkout your callback, you must have received a fake invoice!
See the [API Reference for the callback schema](../../api.mdx#/paths/~1test_callback/get).

## Remove a user

If a user does no longer needs automatic invoice collection, it can be removed:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/v1/user \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "remote_id": "A1B2C3D4"
    }'
```

All the credentials, collectors and user informations will be removed from the database.

:::note
- Using the builtin UI is not mandatory. Developers can create there own one to better fit your needs and design rules.
- Please refer to the [API Reference](../../api.mdx) for more advanced requests.
